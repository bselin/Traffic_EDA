# Driving Licenses, Traffic Accidents and Casualties Analysis

Traffic accidents are one of the major problems in the Kingdom. Many initiatives have taken place in an effort to decrease the number of traffic accidents. New regulations were implemented in October 2016 which increased traffic fines, among other regulations. It is essencial to be able to analyse the effect of these initiatives in order to guide future initiatives. With the availability of data and the latest technical tools, statistical analysis could provide information that would be valuable for decision makers.

In this study, we look at two main datasets. The first is the number of traffic accidents, including number of casualties injured and dead. The second is the number of Licenses issued every year. The analysis revealed that the number of licenses was increasing, therefore it is crucial to ensure that this increase is not coupled with an increase in the number of accidents. 

The First key finding in this research is that the number of accidents in Riyadh decreased between 2016 and 2017 by almost 30%. This decrease, according to the MOT, is a result of government efforts such as launching the campaign "Our Destination is Your Destination", as well as stronger regulations against speeding and cell phone use while driving. This suggests that the efforts that took place were effective. Therefore, the government should continue to work in that direction.

The second key finding is the increased number of accidents in the Makkah region. Makkah has the highest number of injuries and deaths caused by car accidents across all regions, although the number of licenses in Makkah is much less than that for Riyadh. According to this research, the Jeddah-Makkah road is a common source of accidents in the region. Further investigation may reveal the causes of the accidents. For example, if more accidents take place at night, it could be an indication that the road suffers from poor visibility at night.  

In conclusion, the kingdom is going through major cultural and economical changes. Women started driving in the Kingdom just a few months ago. Also, the Metro project should start to operate in a few years. Furthermore, cars equiped with artificial intelligence features are available in the market. It is crucial to monitor and understand the effects of these changes in order to make guided decisions and achieve the desired results.
