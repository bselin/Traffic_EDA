# Driving Licenses, Traffic Accidents and Casualties Analysis



## Problem Statment

Traffic accidents are one of the major problems in the Kingdom. Many initiatives have taken place in an effort to decrease the number of traffic accidents. New regulations were implemented in October 2016 which increased traffic fines, among other regulations. It is essencial to be able to analyse the effect of these initiatives in order to guide future initiatives. With the availability of data and the latest technical tools, statistical analysis could provide information that would be valuable for decision makers.

## Executive Summary

In this study, we look at two main datasets. The first is the number of traffic accidents, including number casualties injured and dead. The second is the number of Licenses issued every year. After cleaning and preparing the datasets, statistical analysis was applied to understand the distribution of each variable. The data was also plotted using different types of plots in order to compare the numbers across regions and across years.

The analysis revealed that the number of licenses was increasing, therefore it is crucial to ensure that this increase is not coupled with an increase in the number of accidents. One of the key findings was that the number of accidents in Riyadh decreased between 2016 and 2017. This is probably due to the new traffic rules and fines that were implemented in October 2016. Therefore, the data suggests that these regulations were effective, and policy makers should continue to work in that direction. Another key finding is the increased number of accidents in the Makkah region. According to this research, the Jeddah-Makkah road is a common cause of increased accidents and casualties. Further investigation is needed to understand the traffic problem in Makkah and suggest the proper solution.
